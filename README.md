# Ulta-List
Provides a list to remember Ulta items that need to be bought or already purchased.

The application initally asks the users to pick an action out of a list. Depending on the action, the program may ask for more information such as "What item would like to add/buy/remove?" Having so many actiona to choose from, I was able to use a function for each action.

A challenge I faced was removing an item that was already marked as bought and had an "[X]". I solved this problem by asking the user to input "[X]" if they already marked it as bought. I hope to make this more effective so that the user does not have to input that.
